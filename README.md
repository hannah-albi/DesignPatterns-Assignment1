# DesignPatterns-Assignment1

This assignment consists of 12 files: 11 java and 1 text file.
There are three interface classes: SmartDeviceFactory, SmartBulb, and SmartLock.
These interfaces are implements throughout six classes.
The class ReadUsageConsumption is used for reading the contents of the text file UsageConsumption.txt.
The class Test is used for testing the program and ensuring the returned results match with the expected output.
The results should be as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The power usage of the bulbs is represented by watts (W)
The battery consumption of the locks is represented by watt-hours (Wh)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing in progress...

The power usage for a BrandA bulb is: 40 W
The battery consumption for a BrandB lock is: 12/80 Wh

Testing complete...
